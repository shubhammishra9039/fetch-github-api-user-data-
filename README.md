I'm thrilled to share my latest project: GitHub API User Data Fetcher! ðŸŽ‰  <br>

Built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, this tool interacts with the GitHub API to <br>
retrieve and display user data in a clean, responsive interface. It's a great example  <br>
of how front-end technologies can be leveraged to create powerful tools for developers and recruiters alike.
